            of the Services, or regarding any aspect of your relationship with Zahid Khan's Apps, whether such
            dispute, claim, or controversy is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including,
            but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal
            or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability, or scope of these Terms, including
            specifically Section 20 (except for the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).

            individual or entity seeking damages, recovery, or relief for injury associated with or suffered by you.
            “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.<br><br>If you reside in
            the United States or assert a Dispute arising under or related to any U.S. law (including the laws of
            any State or subdivision thereof), this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy) and your relationship
            with Zahid Khan's Apps, as well as any Dispute, shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with
            the laws of California, without regard to any conflict of laws principles and regardless of your
            location. Otherwise, the relationship between the parties and any Dispute shall be governed by and

            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>19. Dispute Resolution—If You Live in the United
                    States</strong></h3><br><br>PLEASE READ THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION (“PROVISION”) CAREFULLY
            BECAUSE
            IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES
            THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE.<br><br>If you live in the United States,
            you and Zahid Khan's Apps agree that all disputes between you and Zahid Khan's Apps will be settled by
            binding arbitration, unless otherwise provided herein.<br><br>This agreement does not apply (1) if you
            are a resident of any jurisdiction which prohibits this arbitration agreement, (2) if you opt out of
            this arbitration agreement as described in Section (e) below, or (3) to certain types of disputes
            described in Section (e) below. Please read this Provision carefully.<br><br><strong>a. Purpose &
                Disputes Covered</strong><br><br>This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of
            any disputes (including, except as provided below, a dispute as to whether a dispute is covered by this
            arbitration agreement) that may arise between Zahid Khan's Apps and you or anyone acting on your behalf,
            asserting your rights, or seeking damages or losses incurred by you.<br><br>Arbitration is a form of
            private dispute resolution in which parties waive their rights to file a lawsuit, proceed in court, and
            have a judge or jury decide the case. In the absence of an arbitration agreement, you might otherwise
            have the right to bring claims in court, have them decided by a judge or jury, and/or participate in a
            case filed by others (including, but not limited to, class actions or representative actions). By
            agreeing to these Terms, you waive your right to litigate claims in court and to have your claims heard
            by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award
            is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a
            court (including attorneys’ fees).<br><br>When you first consent to these Terms, you have the right to
            opt out of this Provision, meaning you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court. If
            you have previously consented to arbitrate, then you may only opt out of the revised arbitration
            procedure contained herein, and the last Terms you agreed to will govern our relationship going
            forward.<br><br><strong>b. Agreement to Arbitrate / Waiver of Right to Jury Trial</strong><br><br>YOU
            AND Zahid Khan's Apps EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, WHETHER PRESENTLY
            IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND
            FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION, AND YOU ARE
            WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS
            ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR MASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION (WHERE DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR INJURIES
            ASSOCIATED WITH YOU AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES ARE CONSIDERED IN A SINGLE ACTION). YOU AND Zahid
            Khan's Apps AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER WHETHER A DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO THIS PROVISION WILL BE RESOLVED
            BY BINDING ARBITRATION. Furthermore, any person purporting to act on your behalf, asserting your rights,
            or seeking damages or other remedies on your behalf will submit to binding arbitration as set forth
            herein.<br><br>You understand and agree that by entering into this agreement, you and Zahid Khan's Apps
            are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. Except as
            otherwise provided, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such
            as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may also be limited or
            waived.<br><br><strong>c. Class Action Waiver</strong><br><br>YOU AND Zahid Khan's Apps AGREE THAT EACH
            MAY BRING CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT ON A CLASS,
            MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS (“CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU AND Zahid Khan's Apps EACH AGREE
            TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS,
            COLLECTIVE, MASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.<br><br>Except as otherwise provided in this Provision,
            the arbitrator shall have no authority to consolidate more than one person’s claims or to preside over
            any form of a class or representative proceeding. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
            relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary for that
            party’s individual claim(s).<br><br>Notwithstanding any other provision, disputes regarding the
            interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this Class Action Waiver shall be resolved only by a
            court and not by an arbitrator. In any case where: (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or
            representative action, or falls within the scope of the Class Action Waiver, and (2) there is a final
            judicial determination that the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim or
            remedy, then that claim or remedy (and only that claim or remedy) shall be severed and may be brought in
            a court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims or remedies shall be resolved in arbitration on an
            individual basis to the fullest extent possible.<br><br>If you opt to pursue your dispute in court after
            opting out of this Provision (as described in Section (e) below), the Class Action Waiver will not apply
            to you. No user of the Services may serve as a class representative, class member, or otherwise
            participate in any class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without complying with the opt-out
            requirements below.<br><br><strong>d. Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</strong><br><br>Before initiating
            arbitration or litigation, you must first give Zahid Khan's Apps the opportunity to resolve the dispute
            by contacting our customer support. Please send a written notification to:<br>Zahid Khan's Apps<br> PUHS
            PIA Road Lahore<br>This notice must include:<br>Your name,<br>Your address,<br>A written description of
            your claim,<br>Identification of the Service at issue,<br>Your game account, and<br>A description of the
            dispute and the specific relief you seek.<br>If Zahid Khan's Apps does not resolve the dispute within 45
            days after receiving your written notification, you may then pursue arbitration. You may pursue your
            dispute in court only under the circumstances described in Section (e) below.<br><br><strong>e.
                Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out</strong><br><br>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or
            Zahid Khan's Apps may choose to pursue a dispute in court if:<br> (i) the dispute qualifies to be
            initiated in small claims court; or<br> (ii) you provide Zahid Khan's Apps with a written notice of your
            desire to opt out of these arbitration procedures (the “Arbitration Opt-Out Notice”) within 30 days from
            the date you first consent to this Agreement.<br>To opt out, you must send a written notice to:<br>Zahid
            Khan's Apps, 97K Gulberg III, Lahore<br>The notice must include:<br>Your name,<br>Your address,<br>Your
            game account, and<br>A clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Zahid Khan's Apps
            through arbitration.<br>If you do not opt out within 30 days, you will be deemed to have waived your
            right to litigate disputes except as provided above.<br>Nothing in this Provision precludes either party
            from seeking provisional remedies (such as injunctive relief) in aid of arbitration from a court of
            appropriate jurisdiction.<br><br><strong>f. Arbitration Procedures</strong><br><br>If this Provision
            applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided above, either you or Zahid Khan's Apps may initiate
            arbitration proceedings. The parties may agree on a single arbitrator; otherwise, arbitration will be
            administered by ADR Services, Inc. (www.adrservices.com, (415) 772-0900) and conducted before a single
            arbitrator. Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis. Unless both parties agree otherwise
            in writing, the arbitrator shall have no authority to consolidate claims or preside over any class or
            representative proceeding. Except as provided in Section 20(c) above, all issues shall be determined by
            the arbitrator, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement and any related
            dispute, including any claim that all or part of this agreement is void or voidable. However, a court
            has exclusive authority to enforce the Class Action Waiver, as set forth above.<br><br>ADR Services,
            Inc.’s Arbitration Rules shall apply, except where they conflict with this Provision. Under no
            circumstances will class action procedures apply to the arbitration. Because the Services and these
            Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all
            disputes.<br><br>The arbitrator may award any relief available under applicable law on an individual
            basis and will not have the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any non-party. The
            arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and final, subject only to any review provided by the FAA, and
            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction for enforcement.<br>
            <D><strong>g. Severability</strong><br><br>Notwithstanding Section 16 of these Terms, if any clause
                within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause) is found to be illegal or
                unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder will continue in
                full force and effect. However, if the Class Action Waiver clause is found unenforceable, this
                entire Provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court.<br><br><strong>h.
                    Continuation</strong><br><br>This Provision shall survive the termination of your account and/or
                your access to or use of the Services.<br><br><br>

            <p><u>Last Updated: March 12, 2025</u><br><br>Welcome to Zahid Khan's Apps and thanks for playing our Apps! We
                respect your privacy rights and recognize the importance of protecting the information collected
                about you. This Privacy Policy is designed to provide clarity about the information we collect, how
                we use it to provide a better gaming experience, as well as how you can exercise your privacy
                rights. This Privacy Policy applies whenever you play our Apps or otherwise access any of our other
                products, services, content, websites, and/or the other domains provided by us, together referred to
                as “Services.”<br><br>In this policy, “Zahid Khan's Apps” refers to Zahid Khan's Apps and its
                affiliates, which shall mean subsidiaries, parent companies, joint ventures, and other corporate
                entities under common ownership. We may also refer to Zahid Khan's Apps as “we,” “our,” or “us.” If
                you have any questions regarding our privacy policy or data protection practices, please contact us
                as described in Section 8.<br><br>By using the Services, you agree to the collection, disclosure,
                storage, and use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want us to
                collect, store, use, or share your information in the ways described, you should not play our Apps
                or use our Services. We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to
                review it regularly for changes.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h3><br><br>This policy explains
            how Zahid Khan's Apps (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use
            our mobile applications and Apps. It applies to all apps and Apps published by Zahid Khan's Apps. By
            using our services, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>We are
            committed to safeguarding your privacy and complying with all applicable laws and regulations,
            including the European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the California CCPA (California
            Consumer Privacy Act). We also adhere to privacy requirements of the Google Play Store and Apple App
            Store. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please contact us using the details
            above.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>2. Data Collection</strong></h3><br><br>We collect various types
            of information to
            operate and improve our Apps, provide customer support, serve advertisements, and process
            transactions. The data we collect includes:<br><br>Personal Information: Information you provide to
            us directly. For example, when contacting support or creating an account (if applicable), you may
            provide your name, email address, phone number, or other contact details. We use this info to
            respond to you and facilitate any account-related features.<br><br>Device and Technical Data:
            Information collected automatically from your device when you use our apps. This may include your
            device type and model, operating system version, unique device identifiers (such as Advertising ID
            or IDFA), language, region, network provider, IP address, and other technical details. We collect
            this data to ensure compatibility, optimize performance, and prevent fraud.<br><br>Usage and
            Gameplay Data: Details about how you use our Apps. For example, game progress, levels completed,
            session duration, features used, in-game preferences, and crash/error reports. This information
            helps us fix bugs, analyze gameplay trends, and improve user experience.<br><br>Payment and
            Transaction Info: If you make in-app purchases or subscribe to paid content, we receive information
            about the purchase. This can include purchase receipts, the product purchased, and transaction IDs
            from Apple’s App Store or Google Play. We do NOT collect or store your financial information (such
            as credit card numbers); payments are processed securely by the platform (Google or Apple) and we
            only receive confirmation of the transaction.<br><br>Advertising Data: We partner with advertising
            networks that display ads in our apps. These partners may collect data to personalize ads and
            measure effectiveness. This data includes your device identifiers (e.g. Google Advertising ID,
            IDFA), IP address, coarse location (e.g. country or city-level location inferred from IP or GPS if
            permission granted), and information about interactions with ads (such as the ads viewed or
            clicked).<br><br>Analytics Data: We use analytics services to understand how users engage with our
            Apps and to track the success of marketing campaigns. These services (like Firebase Analytics,
            Facebook Analytics tools, and AppsFlyer) automatically collect data such as app install source, how
            often you use the app, events within the app (e.g. level completion, button clicks), and device
            info. This helps us refine game design and marketing strategies.<br><br>Third-Party Collection:
            Please note that third-party services integrated in our apps (explained in the Third-Party Services
            section below) may collect data as well. For example, advertising and analytics providers gather
            device and usage data through their SDKs. We ensure that any third-party we work with is reputable
            and compliant with relevant privacy laws. However, their data handling is governed by their own
            privacy policies. We do not knowingly collect sensitive personal information such as health data,
            biometric data, or information about your race, religion, or political beliefs. Any personal data we
            collect is used only for the purposes described in this policy, such as improving our services,
            showing appropriate content/ads, and keeping our Apps running safely and fairly.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>3.
                    Children’s Privacy</strong></h3><br><br>Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us.
            Some of our Apps are designed for or appealing to children under the age of 13, and we take special
            care to comply with laws like COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act) and GDPR provisions
            for minors.<br><br>Under 13: We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
            years of age without verifiable parental consent. Our children-focused Apps either do not request
            personal data or only collect what is necessary for the game’s operation with appropriate parental
            notice and consent. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information
            without parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our servers.
            For example, if a child sends us an email with their details, we will delete it and respond to
            inform them that we require parent/guardian contact.<br><br>Parental Consent (Under 16): In certain
            jurisdictions (such as the European Economic Area), the age threshold for required parental consent
            may be up to 16 years. If you are under 16, please obtain permission from your parent or legal
            guardian before sharing any personal data or using any in-app features that collect personal
            information. We may employ age screens or obtain guardian consent in our apps to ensure compliance
            with applicable laws.<br><br>Parents and Guardians: We encourage parents/guardians to monitor their
            children’s app usage and understand our privacy practices. If you are a parent or guardian and have
            concerns about your child’s personal information, you can contact us at our privacy email. You have
            the right to review, request deletion, or refuse further collection of your child’s information. We
            will honor such requests in accordance with applicable law.<br><br>Child-Friendly Advertising: For
            Apps targeted to children, we take steps to disable interest-based (personalized) advertising and
            use only contextual or pre-approved ads in line with Google Play’s Families Policy and similar
            guidelines. This means the ads shown in kid-oriented apps are not based on tracking the child’s
            behavior. We also avoid inappropriate content in ads shown to children by using network
            filters.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>4. Third-Party Services</strong></h3><br><br>Our apps and Apps
            incorporate
            third-party services for various purposes, including advertising, analytics, and social features.
            These third parties may collect and use certain information about you as described
            below:<br><br>Advertising Networks: We partner with the following advertising networks/SDKs to serve
            ads in our Apps. These partners help us monetize our free apps by showing you
            advertisements:<br><br>Google AdMob: Google’s AdMob network provides in-app banner, interstitial,
            and rewarded video ads. AdMob may collect your Advertising ID (a unique, resettable identifier on
            your device), IP address, and information about your interactions with ads. This data is used to
            provide relevant ads and prevent fraud.<br><br>AppLovin: AppLovin serves various ad formats in our
            Apps. It may collect device identifiers, usage data, and location info to optimize ad delivery and
            reporting.<br><br>Unity Ads: Unity Ads (by Unity Technologies) shows video and playable ads. It can
            collect device information (like device model, OS, Advertising ID) and event data (e.g. whether you
            watched an ad) to tailor ads and track performance.<br><br>Facebook Audience Network (Meta):
            Facebook’s Audience Network delivers ads in our apps, and may collect information such as your
            device identifiers and IP address to show targeted ads. If you have a Facebook account, Meta may
            also use data from your Facebook profile to personalize advertising in our app. (Note: We do not
            receive your Facebook profile data ourselves through ads, it’s used by the network
            internally.)<br><br>Mintegral: Mintegral is a mobile advertising platform that may collect device
            and network information to serve ads, including region data and device identifiers.<br><br>AdColony:
            AdColony provides video ads and might gather info like device IDs and general location to ensure ads
            are relevant and to track ad engagement (e.g., if you completed watching a rewarded
            video).<br><br>Chartboost: Chartboost is an advertising network focused on mobile Apps. It may
            collect device identifiers, IP address, and in-game event data (such as level completion events) to
            target ads and measure their effectiveness.<br><br>Vungle (Liftoff): Vungle (now part of Liftoff)
            offers rewarded video and other ad formats. It typically collects device information (Advertising
            ID, device model, etc.) and usage patterns to improve ad targeting and campaign
            analytics.<br><br>When these ad networks are integrated in our apps, they may automatically collect
            the data mentioned (device IDs, IP, etc.) whenever an ad is requested or displayed. This data
            sharing allows ads to be tailored to you (for example, not showing the same ad repeatedly, or
            showing ads relevant to your interests) and helps us earn revenue to keep our Apps free. Each of
            these companies has its own privacy policy that explains their data practices in detail. We
            encourage you to review their policies (available on their websites) for more information. If
            required by your region’s laws, our apps will present you with a consent dialog for ad
            personalization (for instance, users in the European Union will be asked to consent to personalized
            ads in accordance with GDPR; if you decline consent, these networks will show non-personalized ads
            only).<br><br>Analytics and Other SDKs: We also use third-party analytics and tracking services to
            better understand our audience and improve our services:<br><br>Firebase (Google): We use Google
            Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics in our apps. Firebase Analytics helps us see aggregated
            information like how often users open the app, which features are most popular, and what country our
            users are in. Crashlytics helps us identify and fix crashes or errors by sending crash reports from
            your device. Firebase may automatically collect device identifiers, usage data, IP addresses, and
            diagnostic information. Google’s privacy policy covers data usage for Firebase
            services.<br><br>AppsFlyer: AppsFlyer is a mobile attribution and analytics platform. We use it to
            understand how users find our apps (e.g., which advertising campaigns or app store listings led you
            to install). AppsFlyer collects device and network identifiers, install and launch events, and may
            use this data to provide us aggregated reports on app performance. This helps us optimize our
            marketing efforts. AppsFlyer also has an Opt-Out option for users who do not want to be tracked (see
            the User Rights section below for opt-out details).<br><br>Facebook SDK: In addition to ads, we
            integrate Facebook SDK for analytics and social features (like enabling you to share your progress
            or invite friends). The Facebook SDK may collect information such as your device info and app events
            (for example, when you install the app or complete a tutorial level) which can be linked to your
            Facebook account (if you have one) for analytics and advertising purposes. We might use aggregated
            insights from Facebook Analytics (if available) to improve our Apps, but we do not receive
            personally identifying info like your Facebook login details through this — any such sharing is
            under Facebook’s terms.<br><br>These third-party services act as our service providers or partners,
            and they may process data about you for the purposes described. We only integrate services that are
            compliant with platform rules (Google Play, App Store) and privacy regulations. However, we do not
            control the data collected by third parties once it is transmitted to them. They use the data as per
            their privacy policies (for example, to build user profiles for advertising across various apps). We
            share data with them only to the extent necessary: for instance, we provide the ad networks with
            your Advertising ID so they can limit ad frequency and avoid fraud, and we send AppsFlyer certain
            in-app events for install attribution analysis.<br><br>Data Shared with Third Parties: Typically,
            the information shared with these third-party services includes: device identifiers, IP address,
            approximate location, in-app purchase events, and interactions within the app (like launching the
            app or completing a purchase or level). We do not share your direct contact info (like your name or
            email) with advertising networks. In some cases, you might independently choose to log in via a
            third-party (for example, connecting a game to Facebook or Google Play Apps for leaderboards or
            cloud save). In such cases, the third-party may receive data you allow based on their
            login/permission prompts (e.g., your profile name or friend list), but we only use that for the
            intended gameplay feature and abide by those third-party policies.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>5. User Rights and
                    Data Retention</strong></h3><br><br>Data Retention: We retain personal and user data only as long as
            necessary for the purposes described in this policy or as required by law or legitimate business
            purposes. This means:<br><br>General Retention Period: We keep your data while you actively use our
            apps and for a reasonable period afterward. If you stop using the app, we may still retain some data
            for troubleshooting, legal, or accounting purposes. For example, we might keep crash logs or
            purchase records to address disputes or refunds.<br><br>Third-Party Data Retention: Data that is
            collected by our third-party partners (advertisers, analytics) is stored according to their
            retention policies. We do not have direct control over how long, for instance, an ad network retains
            your Advertising ID or how long AppsFlyer keeps an attribution record. However, based on industry
            standards, such partners typically retain raw user-level data for a limited time (for example,
            advertising identifiers and analytic data are often kept for a minimum of 90 days up to a few years)
            to fulfill their services like fraud detection, campaign analysis, and required record-keeping.
            After that period, data may be aggregated or anonymized.<br><br>Deletion of Data: When personal data
            is no longer needed, we will either securely delete it or anonymize it (so it can no longer be
            linked to you). For instance, if you request account deletion or we decide to discontinue a game, we
            will remove or de-identify your personal data associated with it, except any data we are required to
            keep by law (like tax records of purchases) or for legitimate interests (security logs to prevent
            fraud, for example) which we will also remove once no longer necessary. Backup copies of data might
            persist for a short time in secure archives, but we have processes to eventually purge those as
            well.<br><br>Your Privacy Rights: We respect your rights over your personal information. Depending
            on your jurisdiction (e.g., the EU/EEA, California, etc.), you have certain rights that you can
            exercise. We provide all users worldwide with a baseline of privacy rights, and additional rights as
            required by applicable law:<br><br>Right to Access: You can request a copy of the personal data we
            have collected about you. We will provide you with a summary of the information, how we’ve used it,
            and who it’s been shared with, in a portable format (to the extent required by law).<br><br>Right to
            Rectification: If any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have
            the right to have it corrected. For example, if you contact us and realize we misspelled your name
            or recorded an incorrect email, we will update it.<br><br>Right to Deletion: You may request that we
            delete the personal data we hold about you. This is also known as the “Right to be Forgotten” under
            GDPR. For instance, if you no longer want us to have your data, you can ask us to remove it from our
            records. We will delete the information from our systems and instruct third-party processors to do
            the same, barring any data we are required to retain (we’ll inform you if that’s the case). Do note
            that deleting essential data (like a unique identifier) may result in the loss of game progress or
            purchases, so we’ll inform you of the consequences if you choose to delete data necessary for
            providing the service.<br><br>Right to Object or Restrict Processing: You have the right to object
            to certain processing activities or request that we limit how we use your data. For example, you can
            object to processing for direct marketing or profiling. In practice, this means you can ask us to
            stop using your data for personalized advertising or analytics. We will comply unless we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to continue (in which case we’ll explain those to you).<br><br>Right
            to Withdraw Consent: If we are processing your data based on consent (for example, if you consented
            to personalized ads or to receiving a newsletter), you can withdraw that consent at any time.
            Withdrawing consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we did prior to your
            withdrawal. If you withdraw consent for something like targeted ads, we will stop that processing
            promptly.<br><br>Right to Data Portability: For data you have provided to us directly (such as
            account information or user-generated content), you can request to receive it in a structured,
            commonly used electronic format, so you can transfer it to another service if you wish. (This
            typically applies if we have any account system; if our Apps do not have user accounts, this may be
            less relevant, but we honor it where applicable.)<br><br>California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA): If
            you are a California resident, you have the right to know the categories of personal information we
            collect, the sources of that information, the business or commercial purpose for collection, and the
            categories of third parties with whom we share personal information. Much of this is outlined in
            this policy. In summary, categories of data include identifiers (like device IDs, IP address),
            internet or electronic activity (app usage, interactions, cookies), approximate geolocation (region,
            country), and inferences drawn for ad personalization. Sources are you (the user) and automated
            collection through our app or third-party SDKs. Purposes include providing the service (game
            functionality), showing ads/marketing, analytics, and improving our offerings. Third parties we
            share with are the advertising and analytics partners listed in Section 4, and platform providers
            (Google, Apple) for things like purchase verification. Under CCPA, you also have the specific rights
            to:<br><br>Opt-Out of Sale of Personal Information: We do not sell your personal information for
            money. However, the CCPA’s definition of a "sale" can include sharing of personal identifiers with
            advertising partners to serve you personalized ads. If you prefer not to have your data shared for
            personalized advertising (i.e., to opt-out of any “sale” in the CCPA sense), you can request that we
            do so. We will then instruct our advertising partners to only serve you non-personalized ads and
            stop sharing your identifiers for ad targeting. To opt-out, you can use the in-app privacy settings
            (if available) or contact us at zahidshakeelkhan1@gmail.com. <br><br>with the subject “CCPA
            Opt-Out”.<br><br>Right to Non-Discrimination: We will never deny you our services, charge you a
            different price, or provide a lesser experience because you exercised your privacy rights. If you
            opt out of personalized ads, for example, we will still provide the game to you—only the ads may be
            less relevant (but you will not be penalized in terms of access or features).<br><br>Shine the Light
            (California Civil Code \u00a7 1798.83): Separate from CCPA, California’s “Shine the Light” law
            allows users to request certain information about our disclosure of personal information to third
            parties for their direct marketing purposes. Zahid Khan's Apps does not share personal information
            (like your email or name) with third parties for their own direct marketing uses without your
            consent.<br><br>How to Exercise Your Rights: You can exercise any of the rights above by contacting
            us at zahidshakeelkhan1@gmail.com. Please specify your request clearly (for example, "I am
            requesting a copy of my data" or "Please delete my data associated with this device ID [include your
            Advertising ID]"). We may need to verify your identity to process certain requests – for instance,
            by asking you to provide information that matches our records (we do this to protect your data from
            unauthorized access). For deletion or access requests, if we do not have sufficient information to
            identify you (like if the only data we have is an anonymous device ID), we will correspond to gather
            necessary identifiers. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by law:
            typically within 30 days for GDPR requests, and for CCPA requests, within 45 days (with an extension
            of another 45 days if needed, of which we would inform you). There is no fee for making these
            requests, though excessive or unfounded requests can be refused or may incur a fee as allowed by law
            (we will explain if that’s the case).<br><br>Opt-Out of Tracking and Personalized Ads: Aside from
            contacting us, you have several controls to limit data collection and personalized
            advertising:<br><br>Device Settings (Advertising Preferences): Both Android and iOS devices provide
            a way to limit ad tracking. On Android, you can go to Settings > Google > Ads (or Privacy > Ads on
            newer versions) and enable “Opt out of Ads Personalization.” On iOS, go to Settings > Privacy >
            Tracking and ensure apps must ask for permission to track; you can also toggle off “Allow Apps to
            Request to Track” to block all app tracking by default. If you’ve already allowed tracking for our
            app and change your mind, you can disable the permission for our app in that Tracking menu. Using
            these settings will tell our advertising partners not to use your info for targeted ads. You may
            still see ads, but they will be more generic.<br><br>In-App Opt-Out: If our game or a pop-up
            provides a “Privacy Settings” or “Do Not Sell My Info” option, you can use it to directly opt out of
            personalized advertising or data sharing. We will honor such preferences and signal to our ad
            partners to serve only non-targeted ads.<br><br>AppsFlyer Opt-Out: If you wish to opt-out of
            AppsFlyer analytics specifically, AppsFlyer honors device-level opt-outs like the above settings.
            They also offer an independent opt-out: you can visit https://www.appsflyer.com/optout on your
            device’s web browser, which will allow you to opt out your device from AppsFlyer analytics
            tracking.<br><br>Interest-Based Ads Opt-Out Tools: Organizations in digital advertising offer tools
            like the DAA’s AppChoices application. You can download the AppChoices app to manage ad preferences
            for many of the ad networks we use. Similarly, NAI’s consumer opt-out page (networkadvertising.org)
            provides opt-out for member companies. Note that using these tools or device settings is usually
            specific to each device or browser, so if you use multiple devices, set your preferences on
            each.<br><br>Push Notifications: Although not strictly “tracking,” if our Apps send push
            notifications and you prefer not to receive them, you can turn them off in your device settings (in
            iOS: Settings > Notifications > [Our Game]; in Android: Settings > Apps & notifications > [Our Game]
            > Notifications). This ensures we don’t send you any promotional alerts.<br><br>By providing these
            options, we aim to give you control over your data. Keep in mind that certain data (like necessary
            device info) might still be collected by our apps even if you opt out of personalized ads or
            analytics, but it would be used only for essential purposes (e.g., serving contextual ads or
            ensuring the app works properly).<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>6. Security Measures</strong></h3><br><br>We take the
            security of your data seriously and implement a range of measures to protect it from unauthorized
            access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:<br><br>Encryption: We use
            encryption to protect data in transit. Any data exchanged between your device and our servers (or
            third-party servers) is transmitted using HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption). This prevents eavesdropping on
            your personal data during transmission. For example, when our app communicates with Firebase or our
            backend, the information is encrypted.<br><br>Secure Storage: Personal data (to the extent we store
            any on our end) is kept on secure servers. We use reputable hosting/cloud providers that maintain
            robust security standards (firewalls, intrusion detection systems, etc.). We restrict access to
            these servers to authorized personnel only. If we store data like support emails or player feedback,
            those are in secure environments with access controls.<br><br>Limited Access and Training: Within
            Zahid Khan's Apps, your information is accessible only to employees and contractors who need it to
            perform their job (for example, customer support responding to an inquiry, or developers
            investigating a bug tied to a device log). We ensure our team is trained in confidentiality and
            privacy best practices. All team members must adhere to this Privacy Policy and are contractually
            obligated to protect your data.<br><br>Third-Party Security: We choose third-party partners
            (analytics, advertising, etc.) that are committed to high security standards. For instance,
            companies like Google, Facebook, Unity, and AppLovin have industry-leading security practices. While
            we don’t directly control their security, we rely on agreements that require them to protect data
            and to notify us of any breaches. We also periodically review their published security and privacy
            measures.<br><br>Data Minimization: We collect only the data that we truly need for the purposes
            stated. By limiting the scope of data collected, we reduce the risk exposure. For example, if we
            just need an age bracket (adult or child) to comply with regulations, we might not ask for a full
            birthdate.<br><br>Anonymization: Wherever feasible, we use anonymized or aggregated data rather than
            personal data. For instance, analytics reports we view are usually in aggregate form (total number
            of users in a country, device models percentages, etc.) without directly identifying
            individuals.<br><br>Security Testing: We regularly update our applications and back-end systems to
            address security vulnerabilities. We use up-to-date libraries and SDKs, and follow platform security
            guidelines (Google Play and Apple). If we become aware of a security issue, we act swiftly to patch
            it. We also encourage users to update to the latest versions of our apps, which include the latest
            security fixes and improvements.<br><br>Despite our best efforts, please note that no method of
            transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Thus, we cannot guarantee
            absolute security of your information. However, we strive to protect your data to the best of our
            ability and maintain compliance with applicable data security regulations. In the unlikely event of
            a data breach that affects your personal information, we will notify you and the relevant
            authorities as required by law.<br><br><br>
            <h3 class="hero-heading-subtitle"><strong>7. Legal Compliance</strong></h3><br><br>We comply with
            all relevant privacy laws and regulations in the regions where we operate. Here is how our practices
            align with major laws:<br><br>GDPR (Europe): If you are a user in the European Union, United
            Kingdom, or other EEA countries, your personal data is processed in accordance with the GDPR. We act
            as the “Data Controller” for personal data you provide directly and data we collect via your use of
            our apps. We rely on certain legal bases for processing: (a) Consent – for example, we will ask for
            your consent to use your data for personalized advertising or to send you marketing communications;
            (b) Contract – when data processing is necessary to provide the service you requested (such as using
            your device data to deliver the game functionality, or processing an in-app purchase you initiated;
            by accepting our Terms of Service and using the app, you form a contract with us to play the game,
            which necessitates certain data use); (c) Legitimate Interests – we may process limited data for our
            legitimate interests, such as improving our Apps or detecting fraud, but when we do so, we ensure it
            does not override your privacy rights (for instance, analyzing crash reports helps us improve
            stability for all users – this is a legitimate interest). We honor all the GDPR rights outlined in
            Section 5 above (access, deletion, etc.). Additionally, if we transfer personal data from the EU to
            our servers or third-parties in countries not deemed “adequate” by the EU (for example, to the
            United States), we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. Typically, this means our contracts
            with service providers include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or the provider is certified
            under frameworks like EU-US data agreements (if applicable), ensuring EU-level data protection
            travels with your data. If you have any GDPR-specific questions or requests, you can contact us or
            our designated EU representative (if we appoint one; we will provide their contact upon request if
            required). You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local Data Protection Authority if
            you believe we have infringed your privacy rights.<br><br>CCPA (California): For California
            residents, in addition to the rights described in Section 5, we ensure that we provide clear notice
            of the personal information categories we collect and the purposes (done in this Privacy Policy and
            in the app’s disclosures). We do not sell personal information for monetary gain. If in the future
            we ever consider selling data, we will update this policy and provide a proper opt-out mechanism. As
            noted, sharing data with third-party ad partners for advertising could be considered a “sale” under
            CCPA’s broad definitions, so we treat it as such and honor opt-out requests. We have processes to
            respond to “Do Not Sell” requests within the required timelines. We also recognize the California
            Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) amendments, which introduce concepts like “sensitive personal information”
            and expanded rights—however, our apps generally do not collect sensitive personal info like precise
            geolocation, financial info, or identification numbers. If we ever do, we will give you the right to
            limit use of such sensitive data. Rest assured, we do not discriminate against users for exercising
            CCPA rights.<br><br>COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act): As mentioned in the Children’s
            Privacy section, for any users under 13 in the U.S., we either avoid collecting personal data or
            obtain verifiable parental consent via methods compliant with COPPA (such as an age gate or email
            consent process). We keep records of consents and allow parents to withdraw consent at any
            time.<br><br>Google Play & Apple App Store Requirements: We adhere to the Google Play Developer
            Policy and Apple App Store guidelines regarding user privacy. This means we accurately disclose our
            data practices in the Google Play “Data Safety Section” and Apple’s “App Privacy Details.” We inform
            users about what data is collected and why, both in this policy and through any in-app prompts
            required. For example, Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework is implemented: if our iOS
            apps engage in tracking for advertising, we will prompt you for permission to track across apps. If
            you decline, we will not access the IDFA or do cross-app tracking for advertising purposes.
            Similarly, we follow Google’s policies on using the Advertising ID (which mandate that it’s used
            only for advertising and analytics and not linked to personally identifiable information). Our
            inclusion in the “Designed for Families” program (if applicable for our kids’ apps) means we meet
            additional requirements like using only certified ad SDKs and ensuring content and ads are
            child-appropriate.<br><br>Other Jurisdictions: If there are other privacy laws that apply (such as
            Brazil’s LGPD, Canada’s PIPEDA, etc.), we aim to meet those as well by providing transparency and
            control. This policy is intended to be comprehensive, but if any specific local law grants
            additional rights or imposes stricter standards, we will comply with those to the extent
            applicable.<br><br>Legal Requests and Disclosures: We may disclose personal information if required
            to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order,
            government demand, or subpoena). We will only disclose the minimum necessary data and, whenever
            permitted, will inform you of such disclosure. We may also disclose information if we believe in
            good faith that it is necessary to: investigate fraud, protect our users’ safety, enforce our Terms
            of Service, or respond to an emergency that poses a threat to health or safety.<br><br>No Guarantees
            / Disclaimer: While this Privacy Policy is intended to outline comprehensive practices, it does not
            constitute a contract between you and us, and it may be updated as described below. We will treat
            your data in accordance with this policy and applicable law. In the event of any conflict between
            this policy and regional privacy laws, the applicable privacy laws will prevail to the extent of the
            conflict (we will still endeavor to meet the stricter requirement in each case).<br><br><br>
